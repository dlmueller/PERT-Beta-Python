# PERT-Beta-Python
Beta Distribution for PERT project estimation in pure Python.

Motivated by Uncle Bobs Clean Coder chapter about professionalism
I created a pure Python programm without dependencies to third party libraries
that computes PDF and CDF for Beta distribution given the three
point estimates
* O = Optimistic Estimate
* N = Nominal Estimate and
* P = Pessimistic Estimate.

Ron Davis has published an excellent Teaching Note called
[Teaching Project Simulation in Excel Using PERT-Beta Distributions](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ited.1080.0013)
and available at [informs](https://www.informs.org/) that
describes the details about estimating the parameters from
